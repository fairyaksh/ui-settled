# Settled ðŸ‘‹

### About 

The final **coded** UI for Settled's tech test. 
Can be viewed [here](https://fairyaksh.github.io/ui-settled.github.io/).

I have also created a 'revamped' version of the figma prototype as I saw fit - can be viewed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/hjuQreCZrZuHjc4E5NDaMF/UI-engineer-test---Akshaya's-Remake?node-id=0%3A1).

### Additions made in code

* On the hard-coded UI file, I have added a minor addition that I thought would fit the current theme - an animated underline on hover of the navigation links. 

* I have also made the distance input field a shade darker as I felt the background-color on the original figma prototype was too light to see and hence not user-friendly.

* A final touch to the hard-coded version; I aligned most items to the center if the screen size breakpoints were larger than mobile, as there was too much whitespace otherwise.

### Changes made in Figma revamp

* Added a text 'back' along with back arrow button, as it is more user-friendly and obvious what its purpose is.

* Removed the 'read our FAQs' CTA button and replaced it with a question mark.
  It could also be useful to add a title attribute that serves as a tooltip so users can hover and understand its purpose further.

* Changed the header text to be more personalised for users; creating a better user experience.

* Now with more space on the main section, I've replaced the progress bar with a Radial progress bar. I believe this is a more modern approach and keeps the user drawn to the page.

* I've implemented colour palette changes, while retaining the primary purple colour. There was no distinct reason except to provide a more balanced visual.

* I believe input fields should have either a border or an inset property for users to distinguish it between a regular button. I implemented a border aligning to the colour palette and made the text underneath as a placeholder text instead. This allows for more whitespace and looks less overwhelming.
